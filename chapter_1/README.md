# Chapter 1
## Object Oriented Design

 chatper 1 introduces the fundamentals of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. It covers the basics of Python syntax and structure, emphasizing the concept of classes and objects, which are the core components of OOP. The chapter explains how to define classes, create instances (objects) from these classes, and use methods to define the behavior of these objects. Key concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism are briefly introduced, setting the stage for deeper exploration in subsequent chapters. The chapter also highlights the benefits of OOP, including code reusability, scalability, and maintainability.
